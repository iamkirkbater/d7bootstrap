#Drupal 7 Starter Theme

This theme uses a combination of Gulp.js, Bourbon, Neat, Bitters, and eventually JS modules to be used as a starter theme for D7 templates.

To get started, clone this repository and then set the commits to go to Gitlab.  (more details on this will come once ITS gets gitlab up and running....)

Then, run the following commands in a terminal from the root of this theme's directory:

```bash
npm install && gulp sass
```

This will download and install Gulp, Bourbon, Neat, and all the gulp helpers that are needed and specified in the package.json file and put them in a "node_modules" folder.

At the time of this writing, there are no node_modules that need to be on either staging or production machines, only development, so there is no need to upload on staging or commit that folder.
